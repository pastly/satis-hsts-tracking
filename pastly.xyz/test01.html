<p> This will load a picture of the Chrome logo normally. But if you visit
<a href=http://hsts.satis.system33.pw>hsts.satis.system33.pw</a>
and click on the link in
<em>Are you using Chrome? You can view your HSTS state information! See here.</em>,

This demonstrates that your browser adheres to HSTS information it received
while visiting a different domain. It also shows that it does so even if the
HSTS information was 3rd party there <strong>and here</strong>.
