<h1>Test for tracking via CSS resource</h1>

<p> In the process of loading this page, an attempt was made to load CSS from a
different domain. That domain redirected to another domain, which finally
redirects to a resource on this domain. The important bit is that the two stops
along the way try to set HSTS state in your browser for their domains. They
both set a small <code>max-age</code> of 5 minutes because we aren't actually
interested in tracking you.  </p>

<p> In most browsers, the two domains along the way will be allowed to store
their HSTS state in your browser. Safari won't; but Chrome will, Firfox will,
and Tor Browser will until you close your browser.
</p>

<p> The two domains are <code>08.hsts.satis.system33.pw</code> and
<code>09.hsts.satis.system33.pw</code>.  </p>

<p> You can check for their existence in your HSTS state in Chrome by visiting
<code>chrome://net-internals/#hsts</code> and typing them in to the <em>Query
HSTS/PKP domain</em> box. </p>

<p> You can do so in Firefox by closing your browser and greping for
<code>system33</code> in the file named
<code>SiteSecurityServiceState.txt</code> in your profile directory.</p>

<p> You can do so in Safari by using
<a href=http://hsts.satis.system33.pw/plist-parse.py>a script</a> to parse
<code>~/Library/Cookies/HSTS.plist</code> and greping for <code>system33</code>.
</p>

<h2>Implications</h2>
<p> This can be used -- for example -- by an ad network or a large CDN to track
a user across websites. </p>
